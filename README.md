# Hyvnt's WuWa Mod Manager
A stupid piece of software, for stupid people, enjoy the suffering. Sucker.

[ ! ] Warning: WuWa does not allow mods, use at your own risk.
    *As far as I understand, as long as you don't use cheats, automation tools or similar, you should be fine.*

## Installation
0. This might surprise you, but yes, you need to have WuWa installed. Either Steam's or Epic's version will work if you setup XXMI Launcher correctly.

1. Download and install [XXMI Launcher](https://github.com/SpectrumQT/XXMI-Launcher/releases)
    XXMI Launcher it's necessary because, well this "runs" the mods.

2. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hyvnova/wuwa-mod-manager
    ```

3. Run that thing
- CLI Version:
    ```bash
    python ./cui.py
    ```

- Web Version:
    ```bash
    python ./wui.py
    ```


## How It Works™
This is a shithole of project. But essentially, it is moving folders around.
I'm assuming you're a decent human being and download your mods (zip files) in your Downloads folder. If you don't go an change that path at `core.py` file.
I'm also assuming you installed XXMI Launcher in the default path, if you didn't, go change that too at `core.py` file. Stupid motherfucker.
